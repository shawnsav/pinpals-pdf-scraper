Make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) on your machine!

node v10.15.0

npm v6.4.1

There are a couple ways to kick this puppy off.


To just use it out of the box, clone repo, navigate to the directory from the command line, and run:
`$ node ./dist/index.js`

Or, to run with development code, from the directory:
1. `$ npm i`
2. `$ npm run start`

Or, to generate and run a new production build, navigate to the directory from the command line, then:
1. `$ npm i`
2. `$ npm run start-dist`

Other script commands can be found in the `package.json`.
